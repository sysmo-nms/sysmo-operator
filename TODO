- add unit test,
- setup.py,
- keep an average packet time travel from server to client and add this in
the status bar. Move it red when the latency it to high. Use this value
to calculate the probes QProgressBars (step and timeout)
- custom target view with probes from diferents targets with tree views:
. standard target view, look like a target view,
. MDI view, when the user create his own rrd graphs view,
. Map view, when links betwin nodes represent a probe rrd.
- rrd time range slider for individual probes, or the entire set of probes
for targets and custom targets.
- higlight selection in treeview
- rrd editor
- rrd time range slides
- perf: build the maximum number of view widget at startup (total of probe
entries of the treeview).

- windows packages:
- py2exe, cx_Freeze, pyinstaller http://qt-project.org/wiki/Packaging_PySide_applications_on_Windows
