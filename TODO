- add unit test,
- setup.py,
- right clic on targets should open a menu with user defined commands using
probe and targets properties as arguments. Possibly right clic on multiple
selected items.
- events time plots (inspector_events)
- keep an average packet time travel from server to client and add this in
the status bar. Move it red when the latency it to high. Use this value
to calculate the probes QProgressBars (step and timeout)
- customize the probe step and timeout probressbar. Timeout: gradiant from
yellow to red, step: green. Modify QTimeLine curve.
- custom target view with probes from diferents targets with tree views:
. standard target view, look like a target view,
. MDI view, when the user create his own rrd graphs view,
. Map view, when links betwin nodes represent a probe rrd.
- rrd time range slider for individual probes, or the entire set of probes
for targets and custom targets.
- higlight selection in treeview
- rrd editor
- rrd time range slides
- threads (implementation order). Widget classes can not be threaded: 
    one  Socket,
    one  Supercast (encode, decode) (or many if it keep the order of arriving
    messages using a buffer for example),
    many MonitorProxyEvents.Channel (including rrdtool.update)
    many rrdtool.graph
    many QTimeLine (MonitorViewWorking.SetProgressBar and TimeoutProgressBar)
- perf: build the maximum number of view widget at startup (total of probe
entries of the treeview).

- windows packages:
- PyRrd, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyRRD/ peut etre utilis√© avec le 
binaire rrdtool (c:\rrdtool -). Necessite la compilation de rrdtool?
"
I downloaded RRDtool and library sources.
I found and installed Microsoft Visual C++ 6.
I somehow managed to solve some compile errors.

BUGS
- tko do not have updated property list. The problem dit not come
