### HIGH
- SNMP element rrdtool view
- rrd time range slides

### MEDIUM:
- rrd time range slider for individual probes, or the entire set of probes
for targets and custom targets.
- rrd editor
- custom target view with probes from diferents targets with tree views:
. standard target view, look like a target view,
. MDI view, when the user create his own rrd graphs view,
. Map view, when links betwin nodes represent a probe rrd.
. Map zoom, zoom on map show more precise layers of info


MAYBE:
- keep an average packet time travel from server to client and add this in
the status bar. Move it red when the latency it to high. Use this value
to calculate the probes QProgressBars (step and timeout)
- perf: build the maximum number of view widget at startup (total of probe
entries of the treeview).
- threading (Socket, Supercast (encode, decode), QTimelines)
- traceroute tool

ESTHETIC:
- higlight selection in treeview


BUGS
- tko do not have updated property list. The problem dit not come 
from the server.
- Supercast send one authAck, but MonitorProxyEvents get two.
