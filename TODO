### HIGH
- Dashboards

### MEDIUM:
- replace QTreeWidget by QAbstractItemModel
- QTreeWidget with user definede property tree
- proxy.py in a thread (lock the main loop)

MAYBE:
- Use a python version (3.x?) compiled with visual studio 2010
- Rewrite client in pyqt5 or C++ qt5
- keep an average packet time travel from server to client and add this in
the status bar. Move it red when the latency it to high. Use this value
to calculate the probes QProgressBars (step and timeout)
- perf: build the maximum number of view widget at startup (total of probe
entries of the treeview).

ESTHETIC:
- higlight selection in treeview


BUGS
- tko do not have updated property list. The problem dit not come 
from the server.
