- add unit test,
- setup.py,
- right clic on targets should open a menu with user defined commands using
probe and targets properties as arguments. Possibly right clic on multiple
selected items.
- events time plots (inspector_events)
- treeview must be searchable, filterable, and custom parent/childs must be
implemented.
- keep an average packet time travel from server to client and add this in
the status bar. Move it red when the latency it to high. Use this value
to calculate the probes QProgressBars (step and timeout)
- customize the probe step and timeout probressbar. Timeout: gradiant from
yellow to red, step: green. Modify QTimeLine curve.
- custom target view with probes from diferents targets with tree views:
. standard target view, look like a target view,
. MDI view, when the user create his own rrd graphs view,
. Map view, when links betwin nodes represent a probe rrd.
- rrd time range slider for individual probes, or the entire set of probes
for targets and custom targets.
- higlight selection in treeview


BUGS
- tko do not take consideration of messages comming from a probe_status_move
no probeReturn is send whent a probeInf is send.
- tko do not have updated property list. Not sure if the server update it 
correctly or if tkorder dit not take them in consideration.
