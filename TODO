- timeline
- nchecks
- osm
- obfuscate
### HIGH
- Dashboards

### MEDIUM:
- replace QTreeWidget by QAbstractItemModel
- QTreeWidget with user definede property tree
- proxy.py in a thread (lock the main loop)

MAYBE:
- Rewrite client in C++ qt5
- keep an average packet time travel from server to client and add this in
the status bar. Move it red when the latency it to high. Use this value
to calculate the probes QProgressBars (step and timeout)
- perf: build the maximum number of view widget at startup (total of probe
entries of the treeview).

ESTHETIC:
- higlight selection in treeview
