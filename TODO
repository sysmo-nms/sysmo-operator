MAYBE:
- Use a python version (3.x?) compiled with visual studio 2010
- keep an average packet time travel from server to client and add this in
the status bar. Move it red when the latency it to high. Use this value
to calculate the probes QProgressBars (step and timeout)
- perf: build the maximum number of view widget at startup (total of probe
entries of the treeview).
- threading QTimelines,
- traceroute tool

ESTHETIC:

from the server.
